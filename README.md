Various software for science equipment control and data processing.

This repo contains code samples from my dissertation work. It also contains the final version of my dissertation (Figures in appendix, beginning on page 136/148).

Briefly, the project as a whole involved fiberoptic recording (fiber photometry) from non-human subjects expressing a fluorescent norepinephrine receptor. The code samples are either for control of lab equipment (Arduino or Python) or for data analysis (Python script and Jupyter notebook).
