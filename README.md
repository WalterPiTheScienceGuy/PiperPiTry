This repo contains code samples from my dissertation work in neural science. It also contains a copy of my dissertation (Figures for fiber photometry begin on page 136/148).

Briefly, the project as a whole involved fiberoptic recording (fiber photometry) from non-human subjects expressing a fluorescent norepinephrine receptor. The code samples are either for control of lab equipment (Arduino or Python) or for data analysis (Python script and Jupyter notebook).
